# Getting Started

The Guides available below will provide an overview of creating a Marketplace sku, take you through the Vendasta Dashboards that you will be working with for testing, and detail the basic usage of the Marketplace Vendor API & Webhooks. 
If you intend to distribute your product to the Vendasta Reseller network rather than offer it to your customers only, please review the Marketplace [integration requirements](./integration_requirements.md).
