# Pricing-and-Distribution

If you are a Software Vendor, ISV, or a Channel Partner that wants to sell your offerings in the Vendasta Marketplace and expand your distribution through Vendasta's 60,000+ channel partners and their Salespeople please check out our [Vendor Subscriptions](https://www.vendasta.com/pricing/vendors/).

There is a simple revenue share based on the wholesale price of your products. Vendasta manages billing of Channel Partners for product activations, and dispenses payment to Vendor monthly.

With this in mind, set your wholesale price and recommended retail so that Channel Partners are enticed to offer your product, and it has a healthy margin.  We recommend setting your wholesale price to allow Channel Partners at least 20% margin on the Recommended Retail Price. Remember, the higher the margin the more attractive it becomes for Channel Partners to sell.

**Distribution**

Once your Product has met all integration requirements, and has been reviewed and approved by Vendasta, your Product will be distributed to the Vendasta Channel Partner network to be discovered and sold.
