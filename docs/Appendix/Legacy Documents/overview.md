# Overview

## Get your solution into the Vendasta Marketplace

Vendasta’s platform will always be the _**single source of truth**_ for local businesses.

The ease of having a single platform for managing all business needs is is why Vendasta solutions are being sold by **1200+** Partners and their **23000+** Salespeople! Everything our Partners, Vendors, and their clients need is found in the Vendasta ecosystem.

To ensure a consistent experience throughout the platform we have the following **Vendor Requirements. **

### A Single Place for Billing

#### Order Management

Vendasta provides webhooks and emails that Vendors must use to manage orders & cancellations of Marketplace Products & Add-ons

#### Single Monthly Invoice for Partners

Partners receive a simple breakdown of all billable activity, including how much of your product they sold for the month in their one monthly invoice.

#### Single Monthly Payment for Vendor

Vendor Center provides a transparent breakdown of all active Accounts as well as a full Activation History. Vendasta provides a payment statement after each Month's end, no invoice is required from the Vendor, though we welcome invoices for reconciliation.

### A Single Place to Access Software & Services

#### Single Sign On

Allow Vendasta Users to log into Vendor platform or product with a single click.

#### Centralized User Management

User management & User Access is controlled within the Vendasta platform. Vendors may keep Users in sync with their system via the Marketplace User API & Webhooks. Vendor Products may not be logged into directly by Users who purchased through Vendasta.

#### Unified Navigation and Interface

Insert the Vendasta Business Center Navigation Bar into your Product via a simple Javascript snippet. Vendors will make any necessary adjustments to their UI to hide any functions managed by Vendasta.

### A Single Place to Learn & Stay Informed

#### Sales Info

Compelling sales and marketing material is required to effectively communicate your solutions to Vendasta's Partners and their clients.

#### Reporting & Proof of Performance

The Vendor uploads analytics weekly & monthly to Vendasta [Executive Report](/vendors/reporting).

#### Communication

Communication with end users will flow through the Vendasta [Activity Stream](/vendors/activity-stream). The Activity Stream sends emails to all subscribed users. Vendor may provide email templates.
