# SSO: OAuth2 3-Legged Flow
## Overview
This guide aims to help you configure your application to use Vendastaâ€™s Identity Gateway as an Identity Provider for your application. This will allow you to identify users entering your application from the Vendasta platform and will *in future API iterations* allow you to call Vendasta APIs on their behalf.

Vendasta implements the [OpenID Connect Core specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)(OIDC), which includes a complete [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) integration.

This guide is for implementing a **3-legged OAuth** flow. The distinction between 2-legged and 3-legged flows is as follows:

|                                             | **Access Level Provided**  | **Setup Required** |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **2-legged flow (Partner Service Account)** | Access to high-level Vendasta workflow APIs, but no access to **user data** or **business data**. Not currently used by Vendors.| Allocating a Partner Service Account. Configuring an OAuth2 2-legged client.             
| **3-legged flow (this guide)**              | Access to **user data** and **business data** associated with the user performing the flow.       | Follow this guide. Requires an end user to initiate the flow to provide access to the app. |

## Step 1: Technology Review
Your first decision you will need to make is where you will implement your authorization flow:

1. **(Recommended)** Backend workflow: implement the workflow within your secure webserver
2. Frontend workflow: implement the workflow using Javascript within a Single Page Application

**We recommend implementing your authorization flow on the backend in most cases as it is easier to setup, secure, and use. However, Single Page Applications would likely prefer a Frontend Workflow so that tokens can be more easily refreshed. (NOTE - Refresh Tokens are not yet supported)**

Both OpenID Connect and OAuth2 are standardized workflows, which means most programming languages have at least one library available to aid your implementation whether you choose to implement the workflow on the frontend or on your backend webserver.

<!-- theme: info -->
>You can find a list of compliant OAuth2 libraries [here](https://oauth.net/code/). Please select a **Client Library** in your language of choice.
>
>Whichever client library you select, please consult the included documentation for the library of your choice to supplement this guide.

**Backend Clients**

Clients running on a backend web-server will use their **client secret** for verification. Client secret generation is covered in _Step 2_.

**Frontend Clients**

Frontend clients should use the [PKCE(Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/08/22/okta-authjs-pkce/?utm_campaign=text_website_all_multiple_dev_dev_oauth-pkce_null&utm_source=oauthio&utm_medium=cpc). It is recommended that you find an OAuth2 library which supports this feature. *[PKCE Spec Details](https://oauth.net/2/pkce/)*

<!-- theme: warning -->
>**Security Note**
>
>Recent advancements in user privacy controls in browsers blocking access to third-party cookies mean you may need to employ [additional efforts](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/refresh-token-rotation) to keep your flow secure.
>
>The **implicit grant flow** is considered insecure and should be avoided. 


## Step 2: Configuring Client & Library or Service
 *[Vendor Center](https://vendors.vendasta.com)-->Product-->Integration Page-->Access and SSO*

### Generate your OAuth Client
Toggle 'Enable SSO' on, then click `Create Configuration`
![](../../assets/images/guides/sso/OAuth_client_generation.png)

<!-- theme: warning -->
>Once saved a modal will pop up with your new client id and secret. Ensure you save your client secret before closing the modal, otherwise you will need to delete and re-generate your client. 

|*Client Fields*||
|-|-|
| **Logout URL - COMING SOON**  |  Front end logout url (*Not yet functional - may be left blank*). Will pop open a hidden iframe and redirect to this url.  **For back channel logouts, please utilize the logout webhook in the main *Access and SSO* section.**
| **Redirect URI** | Sometimes referred to as a 'Callback URL' - The URL of the page where the user will be redirected after a successful authentication. This value must match the redirect_uri originally used to generate the Authorization `code`.


### Configure Product SSO Settings
![Session Settings Diagram](../../assets/images/guides/sso/sso_marketplace_settings.png)

|||
|-|-|
| **Entry URL**  | The url that acts as the entry point for the product. This could be redirected to from various dashboards or emails. Prior to redirect the account_id is injected into the placeholder on the url, and should be appended as an additional url parameter on the Authorization URL to trigger the start of the session transfer. 
| **Logout URL** | A [webhook](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/ZG9jOjIxNzM0NjA3-overview#logout-webhook) for back channel logout of service provider session. As a user could have multiple open sessions across browsers and devices it is recommended that you utilize the provided `session_id` rather than the `user_id` unless you intend to log them out of all active sessions.


### Client Library or Service Configuration

Follow your service's installation guide, entering the following information where prompted:

|                                  |                                                                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Issuer**                       | `https://iam-prod.apigateway.co`                                             |
| **Authorization URL**            | `https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/auth?account_id=<account_id>` (see Contextualizing your Auth URL below)                                                                              |
| **Token URL**                    | `https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/token`                            |
| **Logout/End Session URL**       | `https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/logout`                           |
| **JWKS URL (optional)**          | `https://iam-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/v1/certs`                             |
| **User Info URL (optional)**     | `https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/user-info`                        |
| **Client ID**                    | Obtained when creating your OAuth2 configuration within the Vendasta Platform|
| **Client Secret (backend only)** | Obtained when creating your OAuth2 configuration within the Vendasta Platform|

<!-- theme: warning -->
> If utilizing an Identity Manager such as Okta or AWS Cognito please utilize their option to configure the IDP endpoints manually rather than utilizing the https://iam-prod.apigateway.co/.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint at this time.

## Step 3: Session Transfer Implementation

![Session Transfer](../../assets/images/guides/sso/sp_oidc_sequencediagram.png)


### Authorization URL

The redirect to the OAuth Authorization URL initiates SSO. The library that you chose to use likely has a function for generating the OAuth Authorization URL based on your configuration.

Your Authorization URL will look something like this:
```
GET /oauth2/auth?
 account_id=AG-XXXXXXXX
 &response_type=code
 &scope=openid%20profile
 &client_id=a69cc85c-6d80-4294-a333-8401715fb36f
 &state=sdf2k2rf%3AAG-XXXXXXXX%3AMP-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 &redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fclient.example.org%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
 Host: sso-api-prod.apigateway.co
```

<!-- theme: info -->
> The `state` param is optional, but recommended. In addition to helping avoid CSRF attacks by using a unique and non-guessable value associated with each authentication request it may be used to pass data through the entire SSO flow as it is included when the OP redirects to the RP callback url.
>
>Additionally the `Entry URL` supports a `nextUrl` param, which can be passed through SSO using the `state` to enable **deep linking**.


#### Contextualizing your Authorization URL(Required)

Vendasta users may belong to any one of our many partners, and each partner may select one of several login methods. Additionally end user access is white-labeled. The branding to be displayed to the user could depend on the `market_id` of the Account.
Thus in order to direct the user to the login screen that is specific to their account, we need to know which account they are attempting to access.

Most OAuth2 libraries will allow you to add additional context to your Authorization URL with query parameters(_though in some cases you may need to do this manually, or extend your library_). Before initiating an OAuth2 flow, provide options to your OAuth2 library to set the account ID to the `account_id` query parameter.

#### Prompts(Optional)

Note that Vendasta tracks user's scope acceptance for your Product. Unless you want to override the current default value for this user's entry to your product you may **exclude** the `prompt` query parameter from your Authorization URL.

The following values are supported for the `prompt` query parameter. 

|||
|-------------|-
| **none**    | Do not prompt the user for consent or to log in. Will result in an error if the user does not have an active session or has not previously provided consent. This is useful for acquiring fresh tokens for a user who has logged in recently and likely has an active session.
| **login**   | Prompt the user to log in, ignoring an existing session if one exists.
| **consent** | Prompt the user to provide consent for accessing the requested scopes. `prompt=consent` is required when requesting the `offline_access` scope.


#### Scopes(Required)

In order to call APIs on behalf of a user, you must specify which **scopes** your app needs access to. Currently there are no APIs other than the User Info endpoint that utlize the `Access Token` granted from the token endpoint for authentication. The Marketplace V1 API currently uses a separate method for generation of its [Bearer Token](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/ZG9jOjIxNzM0NjA4-api-authentication).

**SSO Scopes**

Certain scopes have a special meaning for sso, or are distinct from those used for API access. Each scope is optional, but **at least one scope must be specified**.

|||
|--------------------------|-
| `openid`  _**Optional**_ |  This scope MUST be included when performing an OpenID connect flow.
| `profile` _**Optional**_ | Grants access to view a userâ€™s name, locale, and Vendasta roles via the **user-info** endpoint. 
| `email`   _**Optional**_ | **Restricted Scope** 


### Token Endpoint

#### Access Tokens

Access tokens expire **30 minutes** from the time of issue. They will need to be refreshed regularly using one of the following techniques:

- **Redirect the user back through the authorization process (backend)**. If the userâ€™s token has expired, or is close to expiry, you can fetch a new one by re-initiating the OAuth2 authorization flow. You may pass the `prompt=none` query parameter for users who have already given consent to avoid displaying the consent dialog again, which should allow a seamless redirection back into your application.

- **Silent Refresh (Frontend) - COMING SOON:** This technique redirects the user through the authorization process just as the previous technique, however it is initiated from Javascript by opening a hidden browser window for the authorization flow, using prompt=none to complete the flow without user interaction. This refreshes the userâ€™s token without any interruption.

- **Use a refresh token (Backend) - COMING SOON:** Refresh tokens allow applications to refresh access tokens at any time, even after the user has left their application. This is useful, but requires explicit consent from the end-user and is not recommended unless your application needs to perform background work on behalf of the end-user. Refresh tokens are sensitive and must be kept secure.

<!-- theme: warning -->
>All access token claims are subject to change without notice, and should only be inspected for debugging purposes.

#### ID Tokens

An identity token will be provided in the response from the token endpoint. Identity tokens are compliant with the [OpenID Core ID Token specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken). 

ID tokens are valid for 30 days.

In addition to the core ID token claims, the token will also include requested identity data claims such as the [OpenID Standard Identity Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). 

Here is an example payload of an ID token after decoding, note that fields may be absent if unavailable:

```
{
  "iss": "https://iam-prod.apigateway.co",
  "sub": "U-e7851c53-8a49-4c89-90fd-7a8140888c02",
  "aud": "<my_client_id>",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "given_name": "Jane",
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "gender": "female",
  "birthdate": "1990-10-31",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com",
  "email_verified": false,
  "phone_number": "+1 (425) 555-1212",
  "phone_number_verified": false,
  "locale": "en-US",
  "updated_at": 1311220970
}
```
<!-- theme: info -->
>Per the OpenID specification, ID tokens are [**JWT**](https://jwt.io/introduction/) encoded. When troubleshooting your integration you can use [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/) tool to inspect the contents.


### User Management

``` mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--|{ PERSONA : has
    USER {
      string user_id}
    PERSONA {string legacy_user_id}
```

The _Personas_ that a user has may be found in the `role` list in the User-Info endpoint response. Where a *User* logs in will determine what _Persona_ their current session is utilizing. A Vendor may choose to map these roles to equivilent permission sets on their side.

|Roles||
|-------------|-
| `partner`| Reseller admin user. A user with this role is able to access every dashboard in the Vendasta Platform, but mainly interact with Partner Center, the Reseller administrative dashboard. This persona is never associated with an Account.
| `smb`    | An end busines user. Typically the Business Owner, and their employees. A user with this role and no other is only able to log into Business App. This persona is directly associated with Accounts.</br>Due to the legacy practice of [Impersonation](https://support.vendasta.com/hc/en-us/articles/4406958143383), many Reseller users will have this role in addition to their higher level roles.</br>  _Note that OAuth SSO doesn't support impersonation, and even with an impersonated session the `partner` persona `legacy_user_id` will be surfaced in the Get-Info Endpoint response rather than that of the `smb` persona being impersonated._
| `sales_person` | A user with this role is able to interact with the Partner level Sales CRM dashboard *Sales & Success Center*. |
| `digital_agent` | A user with this role is able to interact with the Partner level task management dashboard *Task Manager*.


<!-- theme: info -->
>Note that the `user_id` referred to by the v1 Marketplace API, Webhooks, and the Order Form `End User` field directly maps to the `legacy_user_id` returned in the OAuth User-Info Endpoint. 

**There are several options for syncing users:**

a) **JIT(Just In Time):** User creation on the fly using data from the User Info endpoint **is recommended**. This is the only way to allow for syncing of Partner Admin users. This is also the only way to get the `user_id`(`sub` in the User-Info response) rather than the `legacy_user_id` at this time.

b) **Sync users via the Marketplace v1 API & Webhooks:** Create users at time of provisioning, and then manage them moving forward based on webhook triggers and subsequent API interaction. 

c) **Many:1 Session Transfer:** Do a many:one session transfer from any Vendasta user into a single dummy user on the Vendor side. Typically used when a Vendor doesn't have User entities.

d) **Order Form:** There is a special order form field type `End User` which will provide the user filling in the form with a dropdown to select any of the SMB persona's associated with the account. If this field type is configured on your order form, the `legacy_user_id` will be provided in the provisioning webhook `order_form` object for this custom field.


<!-- theme: info -->
>**Entry Context:** 
>The `roles` array will inform you if a user has the `partner` role, and is thus a Reseller user. You aren't able to learn from the User-Info response however what persona this user has accessed your product with the current request. The v1 Marketplace API [Get User](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/02b526c75600d-get-user) endpoint can determine if the `legacy_user_id` belongs to an SMB persona. A `legacy_user_id` belonging to a `partner` persona will provide a 403 response. 

**User Info Endpoint**

The User Info Endpoint is available to any application which has acquired an Access Token from the OAuth2 flow. However, the information it provides is scaled according to the **scopes** on your access token.

Here is the User Info URL:

    https://sso-api-prod.apigateway.co/oauth2/user-info

You may make a `GET` or `POST` request to this endpoint. Include your Identity Token in the **AUTHORIZATION** header like so, replacing the token with your own:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2lhbS1wcm9kLmFwaWdhdGV3YXkuY28iLCJleHAiOjE2MTExNjEyMDQsImlhdCI6MTYxMTE1OTQwNCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9pYW0tcHJvZC5hcGlnYXRld2F5LmNvIiwic3ViIjoiVS1lNzg1MWM1My04YTQ5LTRjODktOTBmZC03YTgxNDA4ODhjMDIiLCJmZWRlcmF0ZWRfaWRlbnRpdHlfcHJvdmlkZXIiOiJvYXV0aCIsInVzZXJfaWQiOiJVLWU3ODUxYzUzLThhNDktNGM4OS05MGZkLTdhODE0MDg4OGMwMiIsImtpbmQiOiJhY2Nlc3MiLCJzY29wZSI6InByb2ZpbGUgZW1haWwgb3BlbmlkIiwia2lkIjoiOWZjMGEyYWNlMTNjZjdjOTBiM2ZmZjcxODkzZGJjODAiLCJlbWFpbF92ZXJpZmllZCI6dHJ1ZX0.s12fKo19qKBR4CjMlXqkV0KxksieY7jlgT7Ryg9PH68
```

The amount of information returned is determined by the scopes which your application requested during its authorization flow as follows:

|           |                                                                                                      |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `email`   | **Email is currently a restricted scope** Please use the `sub` field returned by the user-info endpoint to uniquely identify the user.                                                                  |
| `profile` | Grants access to view a userâ€™s name, locale, and Vendasta roles using the user-info endpoint. See the User Info Endpoint section for more information.                                                                   |
| `openid`  | Include the `user_id` (the `sub` claim), and namespace.                                                   |

```
{

}
```
<!-- theme: warning -->
>**Security Note**
>
>From OIDC spec point [5.3.2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo) - "NOTE: Due to the possibility of token substitution attacks (see [Section 16.11](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#TokenSubstitution)), the UserInfo Response is not guaranteed to be about the End-User identified by the sub (subject) element of the ID Token. The sub Claim in the UserInfo Response MUST be verified to exactly match the sub Claim in the ID Token; if they do not match, the UserInfo Response values MUST NOT be used."

**User Access Check(Required)**

OAuth based sso specs do not include clear guidance on access checks. Vendasta requires that after session transfer completes that the [Check User Access to an Account](https://developers.vendasta.com/vendor/df4894447fee6-check-user-access-to-an-account) endpoint be called prior to redirecting the user to the product. If the response to this `HEAD` call is 403, then a 403 error page must be displayed. Unlike the Get User endpoint, this check does support `legacy_user_id`s for `partner` personas, and will ensure that the namespace of the Account and Partner user match.

**Session Management**

The Vendasta Business App session length is 30 days. If your session is shorter than this then upon session expiry you should route the user back through the _Authorization URL_


## Step 4: Dashboard Modifications

### Navigation Bar(Required)

The Vendasta NavBar provides a seamless navigation experience for users to switch between your marketplace application, other applications, and their Business Center.Â  User logout will also be served by this bar, and hidden from your dashboard. **Implementation of the Navigation Bar is required if your integration includes SSO.**

![](../../assets/images/guides/sso/navbar.png)

Include the script tag below before the closing body tag of your HTML to allow for rendering of the Navigation bar. **All** the data- attributes in the script tag are required to be passed as when loading the application. The Navbar should load on every page of the application.

It is recommended that you build the entire script tag before injecting it into the page rather than injecting the custom params individually. This will avoid a race condition where the script runs before the parameters are present, resulting in an empty navbar frame.

**HTML TEMPLATE**

```html
<!-- include the following script tag before the closing body tag to render the navigation bar in your app -->
<script src="//www.cdnstyles.com/static/product_navbar/v1/product_navbar.js"
        data-url="{{ product_navbar_data_url }}"
        data-account-id="{{ account_id }}"
        data-app-id="{{ app_id }}">
</script>

OR if including target-element-class

<!-- include the following script tag before the closing body tag to render the navigation bar in your app -->
<script src="//www.cdnstyles.com/static/product_navbar/v1/product_navbar.js"
        data-url="{{ product_navbar_data_url }}"
        data-account-id="{{ account_id }}"
        data-app-id="{{ app_id }}"
        target-element-class="{{target_element_class}}">
</script>
```

Script parameter details:

|||
|-|-|
| `vendasta.com/marketplace/product_navbar_data_url`| This is the endpoint the product navbar script will use to retrieve the data to populate the Vendasta navigation bar. To be retrived via the OIDC User-Info endpoint.
| `data-account-id`                                 | The unique ID for a Vendasta Account. This is passed to the Service Provider via the Entry URL. 
| `data-app-id`                                     | The unique ID for a Vendor Product. Found in the Vendor Center URL when in the context of a Product.
| `target-element-class(optional)`                  | This field can help overcome css conflicts with the NavBar. It allows you to specify an element that has aÂ **unique** class. If the element with this class exists on the page at the time the NavBar is called to render the bar, it will place the bar directly above the target element|

### Product url contextualization
In the case that a user has bookmarked your product's dashboard url unless you have something identifying [This is a Vendasta account **&** What account it is] you are unable to properly authenticate the request, as the Authorization URL requires the account_id be included. 

Thus contextual urls for your Vendasta Product are suggested, with a long lived cookie, or browser caching being less robust alternatives for keeping track of the last account entered, and the fact that the account belongs to a Vendasta reseller.


### In Product Purchases
To ensure all purchases are centralized for our Partner, any purchase related to a Vendor product must be accomplished through the Vendasta platform.

If your product has CTAs for in-product purchases, including upgrades, or Add-on purchases these CTAs need to be:
a) Hidden completely
b) OR or have any actual purchase capabilities remove, and the copy made to be 'generic' - simply directing the user to purchase the sku without actually referencing them to where they may do so.

## Testing
Functionally testing SSO can be accomplished by redirecting to the Authorization URL in the browser. This will result in a prompt for user login, and scope acceptance.

For an end to end test, Activate the product on an Account, log into Business App, and click on the icon of the product.
